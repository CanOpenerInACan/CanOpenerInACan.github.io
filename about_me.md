## About Me
---
    I am 30 years old and currently working on my masters in data science from Bellevue University. I graduated from California State University, Long Beach in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in business management and minored in physics. I am pursuing a career in the data science field, whether it be entry level or internship opportunities, and always curious and willing to learn more within the field.  
  
  
    In the data science world, I am familiar and comfortable working in large datasets and using unruly data to gain meaningful and actionable insights for a company. I have worked in both Python and R, including most of the common libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, ggplot2, tidyverse etc. I am able to work in data cleaning, variable selection, EDA,  and model building (linear and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, naive-bayes and more). 
  
  
    On a more personal level, I am a huge sports fan and love games of all types (video games, board games, tabletop games). I am a huge Disney fan and love working here, and would love the chance to launch myself into a data science career within the company.
