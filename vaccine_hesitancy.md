# Vaccine Hesitancy

---

This project was looking at some of COVID-19 data and trying to find the variables that contributed to vaccine hesitancy, as well as some of the solutions that should be taken to help alleviate those concerns and get more people vaccinated. The dataset used for this project was a combination of two different datasets, one that had information from data.gov that included the hesitancy rates, along with demographics of the country and the location, while the other dataset included the voting make up of each county from the 2016 election. 


By combining these datasets, we could look at the racial demographics of each country, along with the political make-up of that county. These factors contributed to a lot of the uncertainty with the vaccine and there were several views to take in terms of how to solve the issue at hand, which was people being hesitant about receiving the vaccine, which would prolong the pandemic and keep people unsafe. 
    
    
From here, I took several different views of what we could learn and focus on on a state level or from a national level. When looking at a national level, there were very clear differences from state to state, as one might expect. This could be due to several factors such as access to vaccinations, as well as the leadership of that state. States that were performing badly were North Dakota and Wyoming, which had much higher rates of vaccine hesitancy. This can be attributed to many reasons, such as higher republican representation, as well as how sparsely populated they are. 
    
    
Another approach to solving the problem, I wanted to look at the 10 most underperforming counties and see if there was a way to focus efforts here. Using the demographics and political make-up of the county, I estimated the percentage we would expect to see from each county and then compared it to the actual data provided to me. I then eliminated the counties that had low populations and then found the top 10 underperformers. An interesting aspect of this showed that 4 of the 10 top underperformers were all adjacent in a pocket of Arizona/New Mexico. This goes to show that the reasoning behind the project was sound and there may be reasons this pocket was underperforming, such as lack of access to vaccines. No matter the exact reason, discovering that would make efforts easier to target these counties and expect to see results.
