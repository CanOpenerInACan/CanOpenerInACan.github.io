# Airline Safety

---

This project was focused mostly on the presentation of data and gleaning insights, and then finding a way to relay that information to whoever needs to see it, whether through a blog, an executive summary, a presentation or an infographic. A lot of data science is complicated and without the ability to break down the findings and suggest action from the company. Without being able to break it down to all the relevant people in the various departments, along with convincing the people that can fund the project you are suggesting, there is no reason to be doing data science in the first place.


In this project, we were tasked with looking at plane crash data from the perspective of an airline that just had a tragedy. Being able to look at the data of plane crashes and trying to use these findings to convince the general public that flying has never been safer and they have nothing to worry about is a tall task. Then when finding that it is in fact safer than ever to fly, this now needs to be communicated to the airline and then ultimately the general public in a way that makes sense. Whether that be through an infographic that can visually show the findings or through a blog post where you need to explain a well thought out argument and alleviate the concerns of the worried, there are plenty of ways to appeal to the masses in their preferred medium. 
    
    
Although the data science and modeling and complexity of this project was on the lighter side, it was important for me to learn how to communicate my findings to the people who need to know, whether it be within or outside the company. This project also helped me learn to use Tableau to graph the information and present it in the clearest way to make a point to the people who are interested.
